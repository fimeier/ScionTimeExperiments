## Experiment Setting
```UDP mode```

```HW/Kernel Timestamps enabled```


```xleave enabled```


## Data collection
While chrony was running, the data has been collected with
```sudo mbgsvcd -f```

## Topology

```SHM(AS1,Meinberg) <- AS2 <- AS3 <- AS4```

Remarks:

```AS1,2,3 are ETH's PCs, AS4 is mine (older core i7 second generation = 6(?)years old..)```

```AS1-3: cycles counter 2900000000```

```AS4 :  cycles counter 3502655000```
